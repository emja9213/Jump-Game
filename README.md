# Jump-Game
Original game built from this guide: https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-platformer-game-development/
That version is pretty broken so this is my version edited with my own additions, cleanup, changes and bug fixes.
This is just a project that I'm doing in my free time for fun.

## How to run
python 3 (TODO: Real how to)


## TODO:
1. Fine-tune jump speed
2. Figure out what causes the random crash sometimes when platforms are generated
3. Add start menu
4. Add options menu
5. Make the character move together with the platform when standing on it
6. Fix platforms randomly losing collision
7. Make fullscreen / windowed, allow adjusting size of the window
8. Finish writing README
